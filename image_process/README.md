Studies on OpenCV

This are some of my previous studies on image processing. Base on the OpenCV framework, some algorithm has been implemented (without using OpenCV library, and not optimize)in order to understand the underlying theories.

Some studies is using OpenCV libraries instead.

Some of the image processing are:
1. DFT (not working)
2. White color detection (not working)
3. Sobel filter (self implement, working)
4. Image erode/dilute (OpenCV libraries)
5. Image contour(OpenCV libraries)

All build options is define at beginning section of main.cpp
e.g. #define IMG_SOBEL
_.

Build Steps
sh build_all.sh
_.
